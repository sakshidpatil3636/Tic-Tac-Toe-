# **Tic-Tac-Toe**

## **Project Description**  
The **Tic-Tac-Toe** game is a web-based version of the classic two-player game.  
It displays a **3x3 grid** with 9 boxes, and players take turns to make their moves:  
- The first user selects a block, which is filled with a **circle (O)**.  
- The second user selects a block, which is filled with a **cross (X)**.  
- The game continues until one user forms a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or all boxes are filled, resulting in a **draw**.
